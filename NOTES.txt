1) Note that when configuring the VM, I had to change the network settings to 'bridge adapter'
and then restart the Ubuntu machine, so the router would give us a working IP address.

2) subscribe1 and subscripe2 applications must be compiled with json-c:
g++ subscribe1.cpp -o subscribe1 -lpaho-mqtt3c -ljson-c
g++ subscribe2.cpp -o subscribe2 -lpaho-mqtt3c -ljson-c
